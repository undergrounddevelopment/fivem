When all members of a job are off duty, a NPC is spawned with shop for people to buy from
This allows people to buy food and drink items even when the store is technically closed
This is a fair system for big servers with players from different timezones.
Highly customisable
Config.lua controls what items can be sold in the shop
(Personally recommend selling only crafted goods, as others can be economy breaking)
This stops people trying to sell illegal goods at legal jobs
Fine tune the prices of each items in the config.
Boss controlled stock
Only Boss roles can access stock from NPC
Stock only as large as total possible items? 8 items in config - 8 slots
This stops people using it as a personal stash",- *Documentation**

Bring the streets to life with this lore-friendly gang compound located deep in the Morningwood area. Whether you're running a ruthless street crew or an underground mafia network, this MLO is built to fit any gang style, with customizable touches to make it truly yours.

Key Features:

8 Interior Rooms – Ideal for meetings, stash spots, gun storage, or RP chill zones

10 Individual Apartments – Fully enterable and designed for player ownership or gang housing

Underground Boxing Arena – Hidden illegal fight club for RP events, perfect for high-stakes gambling

Gambling Den – Add risk and reward to your RP with a gritty, atmospheric underground casino

Roof Access via Elevator –Easily travel from floor to floor with the multi level connector

Color-Reactive Lighting – Dynamic glowing lights to match your gang colors

Gang Logo Ready – Multiple surfaces designed for custom gang tags, logos, or graffiti

Spacious Garage - This huge open space with multiple car spaces allows for full meets and gatherings, maybe you wanna work on your cars well it has that too, done working on your car drive you car in the middle where you can snap up some excellent photos with our excellent lighting for that perfect look

Why It Stands Out:

Lore Friendly Design – Feels right at home in Los Santos with natural map blending

Highly Adaptable – Not tied to any specific gang theme; fits Street Gangs, Mafia, Cartels, or custom crews

RP-Ready – Suited for both gang and mafia-style RP, from drug ops to underground fight nights

e68b2350-1c1e-47eb-b129-14413597d839,Woofer Permanent V7.0 – Anti-Ban FiveM & Valorant 100% Aman,"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1
Core Features of a ""Full"" Spoofer
A comprehensive (""Full"") spoofer typically targets the following identifiers:

Disk Serials: Changes the serial numbers of your SSD or HDD (often the primary way FiveM tracks hardware).

MAC Address: Randomizes the unique identifier for your network adapters (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).

Motherboard UUID/Serial: Masks the unique ID assigned to your motherboard BIOS.

GPU Identifiers: Changes the tracked ID of your graphics card.

Registry & Cache Cleaner: Automatically deletes FiveM/Cfx.re cache files and registry keys that store ""digital crumbs"" of your previous identity.

Monitor Serials: Some advanced spoofers even mask the serial numbers of connected monitors.

How it Works: Temporary vs. Permanent
Temporary (Kernel-Level): These spoofers run in the background. They intercept the game's request for hardware info and provide ""fake"" data. Once you restart your PC, your hardware IDs return to normal.

Permanent (Changer): These tools attempt to actually rewrite the serial numbers in your hardware's firmware or the Windows registry.

[!CAUTION] Significant Risks Involved

Security: Many ""free"" spoofers are bundled with malware, such as AsyncRAT or stealers, designed to hijack your Discord, bank info, or crypto wallets.

Windows Deactivation: Changing your HWID can trick Windows into thinking you've moved the OS to a new computer, causing your Windows license to become unactivated.

System Instability: Permanent changes can lead to ""Blue Screen of Death"" (BSOD) or prevent other software (like Adobe or Office) from working correctly.

Important Considerations
New Accounts: A spoofer alone is often not enough. You usually need a new Rockstar Social Club account, a new Discord account, and sometimes even a new Steam account to successfully return to a server.

IP Bans: If the server or FiveM has banned your IP address, you will also need a VPN or a way to change your public IP (like restarting your router if you have a dynamic IP).",scripts,standalone,1.0.0,0,https://sluijfrtqgieucrk.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/thumbnails/1047719075322810378-1766866066776-Yv3qeayd8Qqsa4fYMAm1vIvPsN9lZT.png,https://sluijfrtqgieucrk.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/assets/1047719075322810378-1766866106833-6aQP2VQ19JGI59XWwFRU7xEgeDrNuy.txt,Unknown,42,[""FiveM Ready"",""woofer"",""spoofer"",""fivem"",""valorant""],active,false,false,pending,f941f110-6e93-4b59-90b6-8aaf074ff743,2025-12-27T20:09:12.120851+00:00,2025-12-30T12:57:21.024555+00:00,https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1,https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1,https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1,5,0,https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1,https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1,https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72d5f13312caaf1a00d60eef2960f055faebf2958daab4e93005638003ba9f3a?nocache=1,NULL,false,0

Unique take on Arms

We have always struggled with arms. Especially once you want to select some nice gloves. That's why we separated arms and gloves selection to two different shop sections. Get arms that fit and then go wild with a wide selection of gloves! If compatible, the gloves will stay on even when you change to different arms for a different top.
Fully compatible replacement

Thanks to all the features this resource offers, you will no longer need to have different scripts for char-creator and clothing shops. Plus, we've included integrations and migrations, making it likely to be a seamless replacement for your existing setup.

There are three primary methods to achieve this:1. Automatic Whitelisting via txAdmin PermissionsElectron Anticheat automatically whitelists users with txAdmin permissions, which is sufficient for most servers. You can manage this behavior through the “Whitelist Tx” option in the settings panel.2. Whitelisting through the ElectronAC Web PanelBy adding a user as an admin in the ElectronAC web panel and including their Discord ID, they will be automatically whitelisted.3. Using ACE Permissions for WhitelistingFor more granular control, you can use ACE permissions:    Whitelisting a Group:To whitelist an entire group, add the following line to your server configuration:add_ace group.[group_name] Bypass allowReplace [group_name] with the appropriate group identifier, such as mod or admin.
